As a second part of *"cooking something new every month"* this year, I chose **Cr√®me br√ªl√©e**, because it seemed so fancy and tasty and sweet :3

Surprisingly it was very easy, you just need to carefully do a few steps

I will give here recipe that I slightly changed to my liking as also a source of original where I got it.

<Notice type="tip">
  Even tho you can use grill in your oven I highly recommend using kitchen torch and if you don't have one then buy it, because you have much more control over it

<Tab name="1st Step">

#### Prepare

- 1 pot
- Set oven to 325 F or 160 C

<Notice type="tip">
  If you use something less liquidy than syroup its good to warm it in microwave or use double boiler method to melt it, because it might not dissolve in heavy cream as easy. you can also make your own caramel, but I won't be covering that
</Notice>

#### Boil

Add **heavy cream**, **vanilla sugar** and **caramel** to a pot and boil over medium heat until it comes just below a boil. You can whisk it gently to be sure everything dissolved. After it's done, remove from heater.

***Let it cool down for about 15-20 minutes***

You can check if it's cool enough by dipping spoon and putting it to your lips. It should be a little warm but not too much, because you don't want egg yolks to boil
</Tab>

<Tab name="2nd Step">

#### Prepare

- 1 bowl
- 1 strainer

#### Mix
Separate egg yolks from eggs to a bowl, add **sugar** and **salt** and whisk it

### Combine
Gently pour cooled down creme to bowl through strainer and mix while you do it to not boil egg yolks


</Tab>

<Tab name="3 Step">

#### Prepare

- Cr√®me br√ªl√©e ramekins
- Deep oven tray

### Pour
Put ramekins on deep oven tray

Pour mixture into ramekins and fill tray with water up to half of height of ramekins

### Bake
Put tray to pre heated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes. Check on it once every minute past 19 minute. Custard needs to be wobbly when tapped, but only in the middle. Missing this will make custard over baked

***Let it cool down for about 15-20 minutes***

After it cooled down put into fridge for about 4 hours.

After 4 hours top it with sugar and torch
