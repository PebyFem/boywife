As a first part of *"cooking something new every month"* this year, I chose **swiss rolls**, because they seemed easy and relatively fast. And if you don't do silly mistakes as I did, it should turn out perfectly :3
I will give here recipy that I slightly changed to my liking as also a source of original when I got it. This is first kind of post like that so let me know on twitter if everything is alright &gt;///&lt;

#### Prepare

- 2 bowls
- Set oven to 350 F or 180 C

#### Mix

In **first bowl** start whisking egg whites and sugars until medium peaks (it becomes fluffy without big bubbles, but it's still liquidy)

In **second bowl** whisk egg yolks, butter (remember to brown it!), water and salt

When both bowls are well mixed, add **first bowl** to second and fold them together while slowly adding flour to avoid lumps

#### Bake

Spread it on the sheet pan

***Bake for 15 minutes***
</Tab>

<Tab name="Cream">

#### Prepare

- 1 bowl (preferably glass of metal)
- pot with water (preferably smaller than bowl, filled up to the middle)

#### Mix
Set pot with water on a medium heat

To bowl add egg whites and sugar

When water starts boiling set bowl on pot and gently mix it until sugar dissolves

Next whisk until medium peaks

Add mascarpone and whisk until it combines
</Tab>

<Tab name="Combine">

#### Prepare

- baking sheet

#### Combine
Take your cake out of the oven and let it cool

When it cools down turn baking sheet pan over a fresh new baking sheet

Gently spread creme over cake and roll

<Notice type="tip">
  If your cream is too liquidy or it dissolved a little because cake was still warm, but it in fridge for an hour or two
</Notice>

</Tab>
